# 📚 Books to Scrape: Web Scraping + EDA Project

This project demonstrates how to scrape book data from the mock e-commerce site [BooksToScrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com), and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📁 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0_retrieving_html.py` | Python script to scrape book data (title, price, availability, rating) and save it as CSV |
| `books_data.csv` | The output data from the scraper |
| `Books scrapping EDA.ipynb` | Jupyter/Colab notebook containing visual EDA and insights |

---

## 📊 EDA Highlights

- Distribution of book prices
- Rating analysis
- Price vs Rating
- Availability trends (note: most books are “In stock” due to dataset limitations)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files
2. Run `0_retrieving_html.py` to scrape the latest data
3. Open `Books scrapping EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
4. Explore the charts and insights

## 📌 Dataset Source

> [BooksToScrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com) — a demo website for practicing web scraping.

---

## 🧠 Note

This is a practice project using a demo dataset. The site does not simulate real-world inventory or customer behavior. It's best suited for learning **web scraping + data cleaning + EDA fundamentals**.
